Austin-Accident-Fatality-Study

This analysis was prepared to identify the characteristics of fatal crashes as well as of those people identified as at fault in the crash.  This helps recognize patterns and factors leading to traffic fatalities.
Fatal Crashes Overall examines the characteristics of fatal crashes.  When examining the fatalities by type (pedestrian, motorcycle, motor vehicle), we looked at both crash and person characteristics.
Three years(2016, 2017, 2018) datas were cleaned, organized and merged with pandas tables and visualized with matplotlib charts and geomaps.  
Fatality types, Road Types, Fatality days and hours are analyzed and visualized as bar charts, pie charts and heat maps indicating the most problematic trafic locations.
